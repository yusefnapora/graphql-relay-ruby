# graphql-relay-ruby

This is a WIP port of [graphql-relay-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js) to ruby.  Requires [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby.git).

## Current status
All Star Wars tests pass, but still need to write unit tests.

Everything is done synchronously until I sort out how to translate JS promises into ruby.

Would be nice to make things a bit more "ruby-ish"; I'm a bit rusty with the idioms and whatnot.
